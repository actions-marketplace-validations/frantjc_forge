# forge [![ci](https://github.com/frantjc/forge/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main&event=push)](https://github.com/frantjc/forge/actions)

Library and CLI for running reusable steps from various proprietary CI systems using a pluggable container runtime. This, for example, makes the functionality provided to GitHub Actions easily consumable (or testable) by users of other CI systems. Currently exposes running GitHub Actions (e.g. [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout)) and Concourse Resources (e.g. [`concourse/git-resource`](https://github.com/concourse/git-resource))
